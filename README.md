Login into Dashboard and go to Account -> Shopify Integration
If you want to do it straight from the API check Shopify Integration endpoints
Type in your Shopify Store Domail URL and click Add Shopify Store button
Login into Shopify Store Panel and go to Settings -> Checkout -> Order processing -> Additional scripts
Copy and save text with a newly generated code into Additional scripts
You are done, however if you forget your code you could always click View Code button in dashboard near your Shopify Store Domain URL
Also, if you have more Shopify Stores, or run your Shopify Store on different domains, you could just add more domain URLs using same Add Shopify Store button, and the code would be the same.
If you changed your Shopify Store URL, you should add a new one and remove the old one using the Delete button.
